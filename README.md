# Iris Dataset Analysis
Author: Carmine Giardino

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing the **Iris dataset**, a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics.  
The analysis includes generating summary statistics, visualizations, and insights into the dataset's features and species.  
The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including variable summaries, histograms, and scatter plots for different variable pairs.  

## Project Plan
- **Week 1 (March 31st - April 6th):** Create the project plan and set up the repository.
- **Week 2 (April 7th - April 13th):** Research the Iris dataset and write a brief summary of it in the README.md file.
- **Week 3 (April 14th - April 20th):** Implement variable summary analysis and generate text output.
- **Week 4 (April 21st - April 27th):** Generate and save histograms for each variable.
- **Week 5 (April 28th - May 4th):** Create scatter plots for variable pairs and save them as images.
- **Week 6 (May 5th - May 11th):** Perform additional analysis and enhance documentation.
- **Week 7 (May 12th - May 12th):** Review, finalize, and submit the project repository.

## Iris Dataset Summary

The **Iris dataset**, introduced by **Ronald A. Fisher in 1936**, is commonly used for **classification and statistical analysis**. It contains **150 samples** divided equally among **three species**:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

### Features Measured
- **Sepal length (cm)**
- **Sepal width (cm)**
- **Petal length (cm)**
- **Petal width (cm)**

With **50 samples per species**, the dataset is popular for its simplicity, making it ideal for testing various data analytics and machine learning algorithms.
